	My main area of expertise is <strong>PHP application development</strong> (in particular <strong>CakePHP</strong> and <strong>CodeIgniter</strong>), as
well as considerable experience in web front-end development. I can work from <strong>Photoshop</strong> designs to produce <strong>HTML</strong> &amp;	<strong>CSS</strong> which is semantic, valid and cross-browser compatible, as well as using <strong>jQuery</strong> to provide dynamic and interactive
	features.
</p>
<p>
	I have vast experience in building and maintaining <strong>CMS</strong> applications, working with third-party APIs and Social Media integration. Most
	recently I have worked on several back end systems powering both national and global media campaigns. Prior to this I led the development of a
	multi-lingual system for a large public-facing government site, a subscription-based multimedia site, and an in-house system for a large organisation of IT
	staff. Many of these systems were built and configured to run on scalable architecture to handle high volumes of traffic.

<p>
	<strong>Website Developer</strong>
	- Citigroup, London, <em>August 2004 - March 2008</em>
</p>
<p>
	I joined Citigroup as a graduate and worked in the Data Centre Strategic Support team. The main service provided by the team was an Intranet web
	application, and we were responsible for all aspects from design and development through to deployment and production support. Core skills required
	included: <strong>SQL (Sybase), Java, JSP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and XML</strong>. In my role as chief developer I oversaw the development strategy of the
	site as a whole, whilst also directly contributing new features and enhancements.
</p>
<p>
	With a constantly increasing user base across several countries globally, the system required a high degree of flexibility and adaptability. A large range
	of enhancement requests and requirements meant managing several sub-projects simultaneously and constantly working to deadlines.
</p>
<p>
	The application began as a basic <strong>Content Management System</strong> and evolved to include custom built tools:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Document Library</strong>
		system for organising and sharing documents online.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	· Callout Rota management system for the 24x7 support teams
</p>
<p>
	· Server lookup tool, merging data feeds from various different reporting systems to provide a 'dashboard' view for a server.
</p>
<p>
	Among the features and tools I have contributed are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Project reporting &amp; tracking tool</strong>
		, integrated with <strong>Document Library</strong> and Server Lookup systems
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	· User entitlement engine and account management system
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Tag-based search system</strong>
		for documents and knowledge base articles.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	· Migration of a scheduling tool form an <strong>ASP/SQL Server</strong> platform to <strong>Java/Sybase</strong>, and full integration with our existing
	suite of tools.
</p>
<p>
	Aside from the web projects, I was also responsible for customising a third-party UNIX software package and deploying it across an estate of 2,000 servers.
</p>
<p>
I maintained a strong focus on improving the development environment within the team, and introduced the use of <strong>Ant </strong>and	<strong>CVS </strong>to increase productivity, and trained the rest of the team in the use of these technologies.
</p>
<h3>
	<u>Education</u>
</h3>
<p>
	<strong>School of Audio Engineering</strong>
	<br/>
	<em>May 2008</em>
	<br/>
	Audio Engineering Diploma
</p>
<p>
	Throughout the course of the diploma I learned about all aspects of sound engineering, in both studio and live environments. This included recording and
	microphone techniques, acoustics, signal flow, sound editing, mixing and mastering, electronics and wiring, digital music production, sound design, film
	soundtracks. I also gained experience with software such as ProTools, Logic and Melodyne, and learned to use a range of both analogue and digital mixing
	desks and equipment.
</p>
<p>
	The curriculum offered opportunities to work within a team of engineers on each studio session, either as the lead engineer organising and managing the
	whole session, or assistant. In all cases working with the artists to meet their requirements and produce a high quality end product.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>University of Glasgow</strong>
	<br/>
	July<em> 2004</em>
	<br/>
	Bsc. (Hons) Software Engineering, Upper Second Class
</p>
<p>
	During my time at University, I worked on several projects, both on my own and as part of a team. My final year project was a solo project which involved
	developing a Triominos game in Java with a Swing front end. The game allowed one player to play against a computer player, and so involved developing an
	interactive front end as well as some research into computer game theory. Several gameplay algorithms were implemented to allow the computer player to use
	different strategies.
</p>
<p>
	One of the team projects I was involved in was implementing an algorithm for calculating sports elimination, based on the NBA basketball league. I
	developed the user interface in Swing, and also contributed to the overall design of the system, which included parsing real scores from the web, and
	executing the algorithm itself.
</p>
<p>
	Throughout the course we covered a broad range of topics, including Database &amp; Internet Technology, Networking, Human Computer Interaction,
	Algorithmics, Distributed Computing, Information Retreival, Operating Systems and Real Time Systems.
